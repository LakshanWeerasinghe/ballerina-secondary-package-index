# Ballerina Secondary Package Index

This repository contains the code used to generate the Ballerina Secondary Package Index.

This index provides information about packages in the `ballerina` and `ballerinax` organizations that include Listeners. Each package with a `Listener` will have an entry under the relevant organization. Each entry contains details about the parameters required to create the Listeners.
